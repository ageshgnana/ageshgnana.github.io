    Description: Our bouncy ball demo is fun, but now we want to make it a little bit more interactive by adding a user-controlled evil circle, which will eat the balls if it catches them. We also want to test your object-building skills by creating a generic Shape() object that our balls and evil circle can inherit from. Finally, we want to add a score counter to track the number of balls left to capture.
    Examples are from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features#create_a_shape_class
